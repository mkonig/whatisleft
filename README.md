# Overview

The idea is to check how good your tests are not how good the coverage is.
Shows what can be removed from your code and still all your tests would pass.

## Usage

```bash
whatisleft.sh <test_framework> <project_folder> <output_folder>
```

The **output_folder** should be a new folder outside of the project_folder.

**Test_framework** can be
- pytest.sh
